# How MVC pattern can help me write better code

1. User---(request)--->Controller<---(data)--->Model
2. Controller---(data)--->View
3. View---(response)--->User

..* **Controllers** is for user to interact with
..* **Models** is basically a database
..* **View** is the HTML, what the users sees

#### Why MVC?
1. Better structure for code! prolonging or maintaining a project 
2. Designers focus on front-end
3. Developers focus on back-end
